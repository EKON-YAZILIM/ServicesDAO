# ServicesDAO

The ServicesDAO portal provides a platform for the service DAOs which provide services in a decentralized manner through a modular implementation of MVPR.
- The application is developed with microservice architecture.

## Prerequisites
To run the application, `Docker` should be installed and configured on your system. Necesseary information is [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).<br>
<br>
In order to access the database, mysql client is to be installed on your system. Necessary information is [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install-linux-quick.html).<br>
Example for Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```
In order to build microservices individually and run the tests from command prompt dotnet sdk 3.1 or higher should be installed on your system. Necessary information is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu).<br>
Example for Ubuntu:
```shell
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-3.1
```

## Install and run
After installing Docker to your environment, you can run the below command under the project directory to install and run.<br>
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
A local network is created by docker-compose (dao_network) and all microservices communicate with each other within that network.<br>
After docker-compose is up, you can access the application from the below link.<br>
dao_webportal - http://localhost:8895<br>
<br>
Using below links, you can see the status, logs and/or erros of the belonging microservice from localhost.<br>
dao_dbservice - http://localhost:9990<br>
dao_identityservice - http://localhost:9991<br>
dao_logservice - http://localhost:9992<br>
dao_notificationservice - http://localhost:9993<br>
dao_apigateway - http://localhost:9995<br>
<br>
The applciation databases can be accessed from within their own containers or from certain ports to localhost.<br>
Example:
- Access the container
```shell
	> docker exec -it <container_name of the database> bash -l
	/# mysql -u root -p <name of the database>
	> 
```
- Access database from localhost
```shell
> mysql -u <user> -p'<user password>' -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306(exposed port) -D <database name>
```
For dao_db:
```shell
> mysql -u root -p'<root password>' -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3309 -D daodb
```
Thera are 4 database instances of the application;<br>
- daodb (expose 3309)
- logsdb (expose 3310)
- daovotesdb (expose 3311)
- daoreputationdb (expose 3312)

Application logs and notifications are carried/delivered by a RabbitMQ instance - dao_rabbitmq.<br>
dao_rabbitmq user interface adress is http://localhost:15672<br>

## Usage
To activate a user





## Develop
All applications can be built and run in their own docker containers with the following command;
```shell
docker build -f "./Dockerfile" -t [IMAGE_NAME]:dev "[SolutionPath]\ServicesDAO"
docker run -p [application access port]:80 -name:[NAME]  [IMAGE_NAME]:dev --
```

For the application to work, all containers should be created in the same network also database, rabbitmq and api endpoints can be redefined.<br>

After .NET core 3.1 and .NET SDK 3.1.20 are installed on the environment, all applications can be built individually by running the commands below under the project solution folder;<br>
```shell
dotnet build ./DAO_ApiGateway/DAO_ApiGateway.csproj
```
<br>
```shell
dotnet build ./DAO_DbService/DAO_DbService.csproj
```
<br>
```shell
dotnet build ./DAO_IdentityService/DAO_IdentityService.csproj
```
<br>
```shell
dotnet build ./DAO_LogService/DAO_LogService.csproj
```
<br>
```shell
dotnet build ./DAO_NotificationService/DAO_NotificationService.csproj
```
<br>
```shell
dotnet build ./DAO_WebPortal/DAO_WebPortal.csproj
```
