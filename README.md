# ServicesDAO

The ServicesDAO portal provides a platform for the service DAOs which provide services in a decentralized manner through a modular implementation of MVPR.
- The application is developed with microservice architecture.

## Prerequisites
To run the application, `Docker` should be installed and configured on your system. Necesseary information is [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).<br>
<br>
In order to access the database, mysql client is to be installed on your system. Necessary information is [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install-linux-quick.html).<br>
Example for Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```
In order to build microservices individually and run the tests from command prompt dotnet sdk 3.1 or higher should be installed on your system. Necessary information is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu).<br>
Example for Ubuntu:
```shell
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-3.1
```

## Install and run
Project consists of two solutions:
- ServicesDAO
- ServicesDAO_VotingEngine
<br>
This repository contains only ServicesDAO. <br>
<br>
VotingEngine and ReputationService microservices and their database instances should be entegrated to the project environment (daonetwork) to run the project with all its functionality. <br>
<br>
After setting up the environment, you can do the steps below to install and run. <br> 
<br>

1. Under the project directory, open terminal and run: <br>

```shell
docker-compose up
```
<br>
The command will create:
<br>

- dao_webportal
- dao_identityservice 
- dao_dbservice 
- dao_logservice 
- dao_notificationservice
- dao_apigateway 
<br><br>

A local network is created by docker-compose (dao_network) and above microservices communicate with each other within that network. <br><br>

To project to be work with full functionality, VotingEngine and ReputationService microservices and their database instances should be entegrated. <br><br>

2. Go to the parent directory and clone the repository with the following command. <br>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/EKON-YAZILIM/ServicesDAO_VotingEngine
```
<br>

Enter the ServicesDAO_VotingEngine project file. In the terminal ``` code .``` when you type, the project files will open. <br><br>

The docker-compose.yml file in the ServicesDAO_VotingEngine project needs to be edited. <br><br>

- In order to avoid conflicts with Rabbitmq, some parts of the docker-compose.yml file should be removed. Parts that need to be commented out to exclude from the project: <br>

```shell
# dao_rabbitmq:
  #   image: rabbitmq:3-management
  #   container_name: 'dao_rabbitmq'
  #   environment:
  #       RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: "daorabbit"
  #       RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: "dao2021*"
  #   ports:
  #       - 5673:5673
  #       - 5672:5672
  #       - 15672:15672
  #   volumes:
  #       - ~/.docker-conf/rabbitmq/data/:/var/lib/rabbitmq/
  #       - ~/.docker-conf/rabbitmq/log/:/var/lib/log
  #   healthcheck:
  #       test: rabbitmq-diagnostics -q status
  #       interval: 10s
  #       timeout: 30s
  #       retries: 15
    
  #   networks:
  #       - daonetwork
```

<br>
- Disable the RabbitMQ health checks: <br><br>

```shell
dao_votingengine:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}daovotingengine
    platform: linux/x86_64
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: DAO_VotingEngine/Dockerfile
    # depends_on:      
    #   dao_rabbitmq:
    #     condition: service_healthy
    restart: always
    networks:
      - daonetwork

dao_reputationservice:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}daoreputationservice
    platform: linux/x86_64
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: DAO_ReputationService/Dockerfile
    # depends_on:      
    #   dao_rabbitmq:
    #     condition: service_healthy
    restart: always
    networks:
      - daonetwork

```
<br>
Under ServicesDAO_VotingEngine project directory, open terminal and run: <br>

```shell
docker-compose up
```
<br>
After docker-compose is up, you can access the application from the below link. 
<br><br>
dao_webportal - http://localhost:8895

<br>

Using below links, you can see the status, logs and/or erros of the belonging microservice from localhost.<br>
dao_identityservice - http://localhost:8890<br>
dao_dbservice - http://localhost:8889<br>
dao_logservice - http://localhost:8891<br>
dao_notificationservice - http://localhost:8892<br>
dao_apigateway - http://localhost:8896<br>
<br>
The applciation databases can be accessed from within their own containers or from certain ports to localhost.<br>
Example:
- Access the container
```shell
	> docker exec -it <container_name of the database> bash -l
	/# mysql -u root -p <name of the database>
	> 
```
- Access database from localhost
```shell
> mysql -u <user> -p'<user password>' -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306(exposed port) -D <database name>
```
For dao_db:
```shell
> mysql -u root -p'<root password>' -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3309 -D daodb
```
Thera are 2 database instances of the application;<br>
- daodb (expose 3309)
- logsdb (expose 3310)


Application logs and notifications are carried/delivered by a RabbitMQ instance - dao_rabbitmq.<br>
dao_rabbitmq user interface adress is http://localhost:15672<br>

## Usage
-	To log in to the DAO, you must first sign up. <br>
-	Press the “Sign Up” button and fill in the information requested.<br>

## Develop
All applications can be built and run in their own docker containers with the following command;
```shell
docker build -f "./Dockerfile" -t [IMAGE_NAME]:dev "[SolutionPath]\ServicesDAO"
docker run -p [application access port]:80 -name:[NAME]  [IMAGE_NAME]:dev --
```

For the application to work, all containers should be created in the same network also database, rabbitmq and api endpoints can be redefined.<br>

After .NET core 3.1 and .NET SDK 3.1.20 are installed on the environment, all applications can be built individually by running the commands below under the project solution folder;
```shell
 dotnet build ./DAO_ApiGateway/DAO_ApiGateway.csproj
```

```shell
 dotnet build ./DAO_DbService/DAO_DbService.csproj
```

```shell
 dotnet build ./DAO_IdentityService/DAO_IdentityService.csproj
```

```shell
 dotnet build ./DAO_LogService/DAO_LogService.csproj
```

```shell
 dotnet build ./DAO_NotificationService/DAO_NotificationService.csproj
```

```shell
 dotnet build ./DAO_WebPortal/DAO_WebPortal.csproj
```

## Testing
Application Mysql database instances should be up and running with a testing environment setup.<br>
To run tests from terminal dotnet sdk should be installed on your system.<br>

The easiest and recommended way is pulling a mysql docker image and run in a docker container with minimum parameters.<br>
```shell
docker run --detach --name=test-mysql -p 3309:3306  --env="MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword" mysql
```
To access the mysql instance in the container:
```shell
docker exec -it test-mysql bash -l
```
To access the database from the mysql container terminal :
```shell
mysql -u root -p
Enter Password: **********
mysql>
```
The root password, the expose port and many other parameters can be changed optionally. The test database connection string should be written under the PlatformSettings section taking place in the \PathToSolution\ServicesDAO\<MicroserviceDirectory>\appsettings.test.json file and rebuild with command dotnet build.
Example:
```json
"PlatformSettings": {
    "DbConnectionString": "Server=localhost;Port=3313;Database=test_votingdb;Uid=root;Pwd=mypassword;",
    ...
}
```
After configuring the database, run the following commands from the test project directory. <br>

For DAO_DbService:
```shell
\PathToSolution\UnitTests\DAO_DbService.Test\ dotnet test
```
For DAO_IdentityService:
```shell
\PathToSolution\UnitTests\DAO_IdentityService.Test\ dotnet test
```
 
Code documentation files in format is autogenerated everytime the project is build under bin folder.

# HTTPS Configuration
The process below is explained for dao_webportal and is identical for every microservice included in this repository.
To enable HTTPS, https settings of the application should be added to the Docker Container configuration and the an ssl certificate file should be introduced if necessary.

Example of enabling HTTPS using 'docker-compose.override.yml' file:

dao_webportal:
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+;http://+:80
      - ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
https://+ is added to ASPNETCORE_URLS and 443 port is defined as https port with adding ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443

An ssl certificate can be generated and placed in a location on the machine where the docker container is running.
One way to generate an SSL certificate is explained here.

The definition of the generated ssl certificate in the docker compose file is as follows:
```yml
dao_webportal:
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+;http://+:80
      - ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
#Password for the certificate
      - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=< password of the generated certificate >
#Path of the certificate file
      - ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path= < location of the ssl certificate in docker container. Example: '/https/aspnetapp.pfx' > 
    volumes:
#Mount the local volume where the certificate exists to docker container
      - < location of the ssl certificate in the host machine> : < location of the ssl certificate in docker container. Example: '~/.aspnet/https:/https:ro'>
```
